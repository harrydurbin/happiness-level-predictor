## happiness-level-predictor

The purpose of this project was to: <br />
•	Find features that correlate most with happiness. <br />
•	Evaluate happiness levels in countries across the world to see spatial correlation. <br />
•	Create a model to predict subjective, self-reported happiness levels for individuals and averaged for countries. <br />

The dataset used, created by World Values Survey, includes a collection of questionnaire results for over 86,000 people in 60 countries. The questionnaire asked hundreds of questions, one being, "how happy do you consider yourself currently?" <br />
•	1 – very happy <br />
•	2 – rather happy <br />
•	3 – not very happy <br />
•	4 – not at all happy <br />
